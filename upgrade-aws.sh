# Hetu in-place upgrade for AWS.

#   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhijitsghosh/hetu-deploy/main/upgrade-aws.sh | bash -s -- --region ap-southeast-2
#
# Rolls the App Runner service to the latest published image. Your RDS database — where your
# saved policy drafts live — is untouched, and the app runs its Flyway migrations on boot, so code
# AND schema upgrade with zero data loss. It deliberately does NOT touch the CloudFormation stack,
# so nothing is torn down, recreated, or given a fresh empty database.
#
# How it works: an install points App Runner at `…/hetu:latest`, and every release republishes
# that tag. Triggering a new deployment makes App Runner re-pull `:latest` — the new version —
# while preserving every other setting (the database URL, the Cognito client secret, the read-only
# role). That is why this is a `start-deployment` and not an `update-service`: the latter would
# replace the whole source configuration and drop those injected settings.
#
# The AWS action catalog is baked into the image, so an upgrade is also how the catalog is
# refreshed — there is no separate data update to run, and no outbound call from your account.
#
# Designed for AWS CloudShell (works the same from Windows, macOS or Linux) — open
# https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell and run the one-liner above.
